I believe Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones are colluding to scam Lucky Duck Casino. Through my analysis I determined that Mylie was playing Roulette during every one of the loss events recorded. No player, aside from Mylie, was recorded
during every single event. Billy Jones was the only Lucky Duck employee working the Roulette tables during each of the loss events. 

There were 13 total events wherein losses were recorded by Lucky Duck; in each loss event Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones can be seen at the same casino game.
